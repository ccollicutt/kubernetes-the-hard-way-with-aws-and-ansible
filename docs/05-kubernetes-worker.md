# Bootstrapping Kubernetes Workers

In this lab you will bootstrap 3 Kubernetes worker nodes.

## Why

Kubernetes worker nodes are responsible for running your containers. All Kubernetes clusters need one or more worker nodes. We are running the worker nodes on dedicated machines for the following reasons:

* Ease of deployment and configuration
* Avoid mixing arbitrary workloads with critical cluster components. We are building machine with just enough resources so we don't have to worry about wasting resources.

Some people would like to run workers and cluster services anywhere in the cluster. This is totally possible, and you'll have to decide what's best for your environment.


## Provision the Kubernetes Worker Nodes

```
$ ansible-playbook 05-kubernetes-workers.yml
```
